# Spam-SMS-Detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam (unwanted or promotional messages) or ham (legitimate, non-spam messages). The goal is to create an effective text classification system that can automatically filter out spam messages, which is a common problem in communication systems.
